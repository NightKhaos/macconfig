# What is this?

This is NightKhaos' Mac OS X (10.12) configuration script. It includes:

- Homebrew Packages to be installed
- Setting up Python
- Setting up Oh-My-Zsh and SCM Breeze

NightKhaos uses this to initialise a new Mac OS X machine to get the terminal just the way he links it by simply running:

```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/NightKhaos/macconfig.git .macconfig
.maconfig/install.sh
```

## There are some extra files?

The extra files are useful artefacts needed to configure the environment, like Terminal themes, etc.
